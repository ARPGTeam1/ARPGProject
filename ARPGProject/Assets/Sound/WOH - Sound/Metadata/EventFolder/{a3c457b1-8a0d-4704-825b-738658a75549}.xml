			<value>- When playing the game there are sometimes voices speaking in the wind. The player can’t interact with them (meaning they can’t talk to them), but if the player listens closely it can give the player hints or warnings of what’s going to happen in the level and later on into the game.

- Male voice of Zeus, trying to manipulate Pandora into failing on her quest
Female voice, Eve from the bible. Not ever pointed out, but as a symbol of female recognition and redemption. 

- When picking up Hope, a voice speaks to the character.</value>
